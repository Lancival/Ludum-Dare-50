## The Premise
Ludum Dare 50 has just started. You hop in a Discord call with your friends to figure out what game you're going to make. At first, your game has promise, but it soon derails as your team members cannot agree on what game to make.

## Controls
* A & D keys, or arrow keys, to move left and right
* Spacebar, W, or up arrow to jump. Hold for longer jumps.
* O to open the options/settings for the game.
* This game has narrative choices, and you jump to a platform that has the response you want to pick.

Spoilers for Doki Doki Literature Club are in this game.
